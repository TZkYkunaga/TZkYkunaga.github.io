Damn, Quite a tough time for me. My 2nd period of the school term is now starting :v. That means I have to spend time on subjects at school. There are 4, but 2 of them need me to spend quite a lot of time coding. But don't worry, I will get through that with a bit of vibe coding. Now I'm focusing on web pentesting on HTB and practicing CCNA labs again. I will update more in next month :D
Cheeseeeeee

Guess that I need to update for this now. Still need to spend some more time on some pjs in the university. I don't really enjoy that. Kinda wasting my time and not reliable for getting a real job or internship. Recently I have applied to lots of companies for internships. First thing, I want to know if my current knowledge is suitable for getting an intern (I failed all :D ). Second is to get familiar with what the enterprise and company actually need rn... Coding, IQ, English, information technology knowledge... quite a lot of things. But I know what I have to do now. I'm about to finish the web pentest path on HTB this week, honestly. Maybe I need to spend one month to absorb all the things and practice with the challenge box related to the exam.... Hope to get the first interview this year... keep fighting. Ah nah, not done yet. I'll have time to participate in some competition or challenge. I'm willing to skip all my school stuff for that. At the end, what am I focusing on right now? Yeah, it is webpentest, pwn, and network! See you in February.

Damn, I forgot to update. I hardly know how I was able to pass last month with nothing bad coming. HEHHE. Now ready for CWES on HTB. I will start the test after the lunar holiday ends. During the holiday I will learn and prepare for the CC exam. I know this one is currently free. Hmm, maybe I should find a target for a bug-hunting career!!! Do some recon... explore func... alright, that is all I'm going to do this month! Should I read a book too?? Ehehe, see you next month!!!
