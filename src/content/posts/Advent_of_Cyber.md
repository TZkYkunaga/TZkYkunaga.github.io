Hi there! this blog is my review of **Advent of Cyber 2025** 

Well, It is worth your time to have fun with. I spend about 2~3 days to do all the challenges. I already have the basic knowledge which is all i need to beat every challs without reading the concept.🙂. But i think you should read them all for review back.  Oh there are still some barriers for me with forensic and window analytics. Sometimes i have to interact with some new tools... hell yeah attack box and virtual machines kinda lag and have high ping cuz the server is quite far away from my country. There are always some things that i dont know so i take a look at the video for it’s convenience! yeah

By the way the cert is cool and hope that the knowledge i gain from the course will be helpful in the future !!!
