Hi! Let's talk about one famous platform to learn about cybersecurity. Recently, I have been learning on HACKTHEBOX.

Well, it's really worth it for a new learner like me to explore. The knowledge provided from each module I learned was quite a lot and needs to be noted often. At first, they give you 50 cubes, which you can buy a module with and have a reward back. However, I noticed that the rewards you get back are usually equal to or less than the cost. So I decided to pay for monthly billing for a student for about $8. Because the challenge and quiz in each section really make me learn more.

The other way, to pass the skill assessment, you need to handle all of each session. If you skip once, you won't be able to pass.

Now I am aiming to earn a **Hack The Box certification** because I believe it will be a great addition to my resume and a strong advantage in future interviews.

I will update more about htb in future !!!!!


Thank you for reading about my learning journey!!
